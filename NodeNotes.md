<h3>About Packages and Modules:</h3>

---

<p>npm registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules.</p>

<br>
<h4>About Packages:</h4>

---â™£

<p>A <b>package</b> is a file or directory that is described by a <span style ="color:#DDA0DD">package.json</span> file. A package must contain a <span style ="color:#DDA0DD">package.json</span> file in order to be published to the npm registry.</p>
<p>Packages can be unscoped or scoped to a user or organization, and scoped packages can be private or public.</p>

  * git+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish

  * git+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish

<h3>About modules</h3>

---

<p>A <b><span style ="color: #4d4dff">module</span> </b> is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.</p>

To be loaded by the Node.js require() function, a module must be one of the following:

- A folder with a package.json file containing a "main" field.
- A JavaScript file.

**Note:** <span style ="color: #4d4dff">Modules</span> don't need <span style ="color:#DDA0DD">package.json</span> file, not all <span style ="color: #4d4dff">modules</span> are <span style ="color:#DDA0DD">packages</span>, only those with <span style ="color:#DDA0DD">package.json</span> file are.

For example:

```js
var req = require($module);
```

<br><br>

<h3>About Scopes</h3>

---

<p>Scopes allow you to create a package<span style ="font-size:80%; color: yellow" >(even if package was made by other user)</span> without conflict</p>
The scope name is everything between the @ and the slash:

```js
  @scope/package-name
```

Tips:

- Unscoped packages are PUBLIC
- PRIVATE packages are always scoped
- **Scoped packages are private by default; you must make them public.**
