## Using EJS

# Editing Using EJS with Express

In Express v4, a very basic setup using EJS would look like the following. (This assumes a `views` directory containing an `index.ejs` page.)

```javascript
let express = require("express");
let app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", { foo: "FOO" });
});

app.listen(4000, () => console.log("Example app listening on port 4000!"));
```

There are a number of ways to pass specific configuration values to EJS from Express.

## View options

---

This is the most straightforward method, although `view options` has not been a documented option to use with Express since version 2. Use `app.set` to set `view options`:

```javascript
app.set("view options", { delimiter: "?" });
```

This method works for all options, even those which cannot be safely passed along with data, like `root`. It also allows you to set EJS options once, in one place.

## Custom render function

---

This is somewhat less straightforward, but also works well -- completely overrides the render function:

```javascript
let ejsOptions = { delimiter: "?" };
app.engine("ejs", (path, data, cb) => {
  ejs.renderFile(path, data, ejsOptions, cb);
});
```

This method works for all options, even those which cannot be safely passed along with data, like `root`. It also allows you to set EJS options once, in one place.

## App locals

---

Any properties set on `app.locals` will get mixed in to the `data` object passed into a render call for the view engine, and those with names matching known opts properties will be passed to EJS as opts:

```javascript
app.locals.delimiter = "?";
```

This does allow you to set your EJS options in one place, but will not work for unsafe options like `root`.

## Passing opts with data

---

Any properties in the data object for a `render` call with names matching known opts properties will be passed to EJS as opts:

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", { foo: "FOO", delimiter: "?" });
});
```

This approach means you have to pass EJS options in every single render call, and also does not work with unsafe options like `root`.
