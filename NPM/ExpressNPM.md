the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```console
$ npm install express
```

Follow [our installing guide](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
for more information.

**PROTIP** Be sure to read [Migrating from 3.x to 4.x](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki/Migrating-from-3.x-to-4.x) as well as [New features in 4.x](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki/New-features-in-4.x).

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:

Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```console
$ npm install -g express-generator@4
```

Create the app:

```console
$ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

Start the server:

```console
$ npm start
```

View the website at: http://localhost:3000

## Examples

To view the examples, clone the Express repo and install the dependencies:

```console
$ git clone git://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1
$ cd express
$ npm install
```

Then run whichever example you want:

```console
$ node examples/content-negotiation
```

### Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Express, please see [Security Policies and Procedures](Security.md).

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, first install the dependencies, then run `npm test`:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

## Basic routing

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:

```js
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);
```

Where:

- app is an instance of express.
- METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
- PATH is a path on the server.
- HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.
